	<h3>What is the IPP / CUPS printer extension?</h3>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">This extension allows you to print directly to a <a href="http://www.cups.org" target="_blank">CUPS</a> print server or IPP compatible printer. </b>
	</p>
	<p>IPP stands for Internet Printing Protocol a protocol used by some printers to accpet print jobs.</p>

	<p>When using IPP, Google Cloud print <b>is not</b> required, your documents stay within your local network - unless you set it up specifically to print across the Internet.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h3>Analytics consent</h3>

		<p>I am trying to constantly improve this extension - <b>you can help</b> by allowing anonymous analytics data to be collected.
			<br>This will help to build a <b>list of supported printers</b>.
			<br>The extension automatically collects info on: extension version, print failures &amp; success, pagecount and printer make/model information.
			<br>No information about the contents of printed items is sent, reported, shared, or stored.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br><b>Please uncheck this box if you do not want to share analytics data:</b>

	<h3>Enterprise or education user?</h3>

	<p>This extension is designed for home users. You require an extension where printers are managed on behalf of your end users.<br> Luckily we have such a solution,<a href="https://directprint.io/cups-for-gadmins.html" target="_blank"> details here.</a></p>
	<p>Use this extension to export printer configurations into the required JSON format for upload to the G Suite admin console.</p>
	<p>For advanced printer managment please see <a href="https://directprint.io">directprint.io</a>, which offers reporting, supply managment, enforcement of print policies, managed and unmanaged users.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>How do I get it to work?</h3>

	<p>1) You need a CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) service configured and running on your local network <b>or</b> a printer that natively supports the IPP protocol.</p>
	<p>2) You need the full IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) address of the printer. This application (unlike e.g. Airprint) does not automatically discover printers on the network. This is due to a current limitation with public Chrome extensions not being able to scan the network for printers.</p>
	<p>The address needs to include the http:// or https:// prefix.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>How do I find the IPP address of the printer?</h3>

	<p>Using CUPS: Go to the CUPS admin page on your CUPS server (typically http://your_address:631/) Select 'Printers', then the link to the printer you want to use. Your browser address bar should now contain the IPP address, which should look something like this: http://192.168.1.101:631/printers/Dell_C1765nfw_Color_MFP_</p>
	<p>Paste this address into the server address area, and give the printer a friendly name (e.g. Office 103 printer).</p>

	</center>
	<p></p>
	<p>For printing direct to a printer that supports IPP (Internet Printing Protocol): Consult your printers documentation or configuration menu to find the full IPP address.</p>
	<p>Please note if you are connecting direct to a printer (not via CUPS) the IPP printer <b>MUST SUPPORT PDF, PWG, Postscript or Unirast document types</b>. Check the specifications carefully for this support.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h3>How do I know if my printer is compatible?</h3>
	<p>Either consult the printer specs looking for the PDF/PWG/URF/Postscript compatibility or test the printer using the test function in the <a href="master.html">management page.</a></p>
	<p>After entering the IPP address and name for the printer, click save.</p>
	<p>Clicking the info button <img src="icons/info.png"> will query the printer for it's capability.</p>
	<p>If the printer is compatible then it will show <b>PASS</b>.</p>
	<p>If the printer is not reporting compatibility it will show <b>FAIL</b> You can attempt to print regardless of the test result.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>How do I print?</h3>

	<p>Just select the IPP printer from the printer options dialogue when you &lt;ctrl-p&gt; or select print from the Chrome menu.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h3>What happens once the print job is sent?</h3>

	<p>Chrome will show a notification in the bottom-right corner which contains a success or failure code.</p>
	<p>If your print job is large (e.g. a few MB) then it will take time to notify.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<a href="#errors">
		<h3>Common error codes</h3>
	</a>

	<p><b>IPP Server status code: client-error-not-found</b>

		<br>The address of the print server is incorrect, check the address and re-enter.</p>
	<p><b>Cannot contact printer - check URL & connectivity / Type error: Failed to fetch</b>

		<br>The system cannot resolve the name of the printer. Please check the name or enter the IP address instead.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Permissions and security</h3>

	<p>The extension requests access for communications to http://*/* and https://*/* as it needs to send print jobs to the printer or print server.
		<br>The Chrome permission request looks like this: <b>"Read and modify all your data on all websites you visit".</b> The permission is explained
		<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings">here about half way down the page.</a>
		<br>The extension <b>does not require access to passwords</b> or other sensitive information.
		<br>The extension <b>does not store any print jobs or documents.</b>
